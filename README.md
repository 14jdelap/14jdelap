### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer specialized in platform and devex. I have several years of Go, JavaScript, and Ruby experience. I'm currently working in the DevEx team at Thought Machine with a focus on how we build and run our monorepo.

I also co-created Horus ([tryhorus.com](https://www.tryhorus.com)), a full-stack, open-source observability system for distributed microservices

I'm based in London 🇬🇧, but have previously lived in Berlin 🇩🇪, Cambridge 🇺🇸, Lima 🇵🇪, and Madrid 🇪🇸

Outside of work, I've summited two 5,500 meter glaciers and have run a 50KM race

### Hi there 👋 I'm José

💻 I'm a full-stack software engineer with several years of JavaScript and Ruby experience (I've also dabbled with Go and Python)

📈 I co-created Horus ([tryhorus.com](https://www.tryhorus.com)), a full-stack observability system for distributed microservices

🇬🇧 I'm based in London, but have previously lived in Berlin 🇩🇪, Cambridge 🇺🇸, Lima 🇵🇪, and Madrid 🇪🇸

👯 I'm mainly interested in back-end and data-engineering, but can work across the full-stack

🏔 I've made two 5,500 meter glacier summits

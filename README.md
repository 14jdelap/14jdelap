### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a software and distributed systems engineer with several years of Go, JavaScript, and Ruby experience. I'm currently working on a high-throughput event processing system at Thought Machine

I also co-created Horus ([tryhorus.com](https://www.tryhorus.com)), a full-stack, open-source observability system for distributed microservices

I'm based in London ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§, but have previously lived in Berlin ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª, Cambridge ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸, Lima ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª, and Madrid ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸

Outside of work, I've summited two 5,500 meter glaciers and have run a 50KM race
